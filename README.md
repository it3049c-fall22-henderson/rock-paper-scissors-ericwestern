## Self-Evaluation: 
Ran behind on this one, should have completed before a trip I needed to make rather than after. Tests do not pass, do not match what is in assignment (welcome form vs name form) and I did not update for reset button or selection buttons rather than drop down.

## Team Reflection:
No struggles


### How long it took us to finish this?
Couple hours total.
